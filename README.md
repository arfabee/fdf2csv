# PDF Form Data Extraction and CSV Generator 

This little script allows you to recursively generate FDF files from PDFs and extract field data from FDF files. The extracted data is then saved to a single CSV file.

## Features

- Generates FDF files from PDFs in the current directory in a temporary directory.
- Extracts field data from FDF files and creates a common CSV file.

## Prerequisites

- [pdftk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) - You need to have pdftk installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/arfabee/fdf2csv.git
   
2. Make the script executable and run it

   ```shell
   chmod +x script.sh && ./fdf2csv.sh

3. The script will generate FDF files from PDFs in the current directory and extract the field data into a CSV file named all_data.csv.

M.A. 
ðŸ˜„ Happy PDF data extraction and CSV generation!
